This parser takes bibtex files and converts to a Micrisoft Excel spreasheet associating manuscripts to authors in different tables. It may be used to help on performing systematic mapping studies or literature reviews in which many references are collected from automatic search engines, such as IEEEXplore or ACM Portal, and then must be catalogued someway. Using an Excel spreadsheet may help on identifying duplicated entries, counting authors and creating dynamic tables/graphics.
